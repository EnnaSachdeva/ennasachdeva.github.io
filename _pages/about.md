I'm a Research Engineer at [Honda Research Institute, USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), where I develop embodied AI agents that leverage vision, language, and dynamic interaction models to build interpretable and adaptive autonomous systems that enhance trust and safety. My current focus is on building future agents that co-adapt with humans, model complex interactions, and plan collaboratively in dynamic environments. I hold an M.S. in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/) (2020), advised by [Dr. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/) with [Intel AI Lab](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/researchers.html) collaboration ([MS thesis](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/44558m99c)), and an M.S. in ECE with a major in Robotics from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), under [Dr. Madhava Krishna](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/) and [Dr. Abhishek Sarkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abhishek_Sarkar4) ([MS thesis](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiI-JWR-8vuAhWFtJ4KHVa7Az4QFjAAegQIBBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb2py.iiit.ac.in%2Fresearch_centres%2Fpublications%2Fdownload%2Fmastersthesis.pdf.8500de55f6080e24.6d61696e2e706466.pdf&usg=AOvVaw124iKWYTP-f_KY_OKCL4V4for)). My research interests include Explainable AI, Multiagent Systems, and Robotics.
