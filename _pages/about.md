* I am a Robotics Grad student in the [CORIS department](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/). My Graduate research Advisor is [ Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/).
* I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in [YMCA University of Science and Technology](http://www.ymcaust.ac.in/), and MS in Electronics and Computer Engineering, with major in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
* My research interests span applying Artificial Intelligence to address core challenging problems in Robotics. Particularly, I am interested in Machine learning, Deep Reinforcement learning, Genetic Algorithms, and their applications in Motion Planning, Sequential Decision Making and multiagent systems.
