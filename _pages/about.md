* I'm a Research Engineer at [Honda Research Institute, USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), working on visual scene understanding towards developing explainable models for mobility applications. I'm interested in designing human-interpretable, robust, interaction-aware intelligent agents, by leveraging domain knowledge and rules.
* I graduated with a Master of Science in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/) in 2020, where I was advised by [Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/) and collaborated with [Intel AI Lab](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/researchers.html) for my thesis.[pdf](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/gq67jz60h?locale=en). 
* Before that, I obtained a Master of Science in Electronics and Computer Engineering, majoring in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/) and [Dr. Abhishek Sarkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abhishek_Sarkar4).[pdf](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiI-JWR-8vuAhWFtJ4KHVa7Az4QFjAAegQIBBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb2py.iiit.ac.in%2Fresearch_centres%2Fpublications%2Fdownload%2Fmastersthesis.pdf.8500de55f6080e24.6d61696e2e706466.pdf&usg=AOvVaw124iKWYTP-f_KY_OKCL4V4for). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [YMCA University of Science and Technology](https://jcboseust.ac.in/).
* My research interests span Explainable AI, Multiagent Systems, and Robotics. I'm very open to research discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to get in touch!
