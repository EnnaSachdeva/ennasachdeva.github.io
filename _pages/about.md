* I am currently a Research Intern at [Honda Research Institute, USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), where I'm working on predicting, explaining and grounding evolving relationships for intelligent multiagent systems.
* I recently graduated with Master of Science in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/) under the supervision of [ Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/). A few of the key research areas I worked on include addressing credit assignment problem in single agent and multiagent coordination tasks with sparse binary rewards, using Deep Reinforcement learning and Evolutionary algorithms. My thesis work focusses on leveraging domain knowledge to solve multiagent coordination tasks, via Dynamic Skill selection. 
* Prior to that, I obtained an MS in Electronics and Computer Engineering, with major in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), and a Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [YMCA University of Science and Technology](https://jcboseust.ac.in/).
* My research interests span Explainable AI, Multiagent systems, and Robotics. I'm very open to research discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to get in touch!
