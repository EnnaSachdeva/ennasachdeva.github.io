* I'm a Research Engineer at [Honda Research Institute, USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), where my focus is on interpretable and explainable Machine learning models for autonomous driving. I'm interested in understanding the spatio-temporal multiagent interactions, and infusing domain knowledge for robust and human-interpretable models. I'm currently working on developing data-driven methods to learn semantically meaningful evolving spatial-temporal relationships between interacting agents.   
* I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/). I had been fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/) and collaborate with [Intel AI Lab](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/researchers.html) for my master's thesis. My thesis work focusses on leveraging domain knowledge to address credit assignment problem in multiagent coordination tasks, via Dynamic Skill selection using Deep reinforcement learning and Evolutionary methods. Here is my master's thesis. [pdf](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/gq67jz60h?locale=en)
* Before that, I obtained a Master of Science in Electronics and Computer Engineering, majoring in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I had been advised by [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/) and [Dr. Abhishek Sarkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abhishek_Sarkar4). I designed and developed a novel Compliant omnicrawler-wheel transforming module for modular robots, which can be integrated with various categories of robots, such as an in-pipe climbing robot, Quadruped, snake robot, robotic manipulator, and legged robots. Here is my master's thesis.

* I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [YMCA University of Science and Technology](https://jcboseust.ac.in/).
* My research interests span Explainable AI, Multiagent Systems, and Robotics. I'm very open to research discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to get in touch!
