* I am currently a Research Intern at [Honda Research Institute, USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), where I'm working on predicting and explaining grounded dynamically evolving relationships among multiple agents. I am interested in understanding what's going on in the latent representation layers, and developing data driven techniques to  learn dynamically evolving spatial-temporal relations between multiple agents.  
* I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/). I had been fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/) and collaborate with [Intel AI Lab](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/researchers.html) for my master's thesis. A few of the research areas I worked on include addressing credit assignment problem in single agent and multiagent coordination tasks with sparse binary rewards, using Deep Reinforcement learning and Evolutionary algorithms. My thesis work focusses on leveraging domain knowledge to solve multiagent coordination tasks, via Dynamic Skill selection. [pdf](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/gq67jz60h?locale=en)
* Before that, I obtained a Master of Science in Electronics and Computer Engineering, majoring in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I had been advised by [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/) and [Dr. Abhishek Sarkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abhishek_Sarkar4). During my masters, I designed and developed a novel Compliant omnicrawler-wheel transforming module for modular robots. The modular design's versatility facilitates its integration with various categories of robots, such as an in-pipe climbing robot, Quadruped, snake robot, robotic manipulator, and legged robots. Here is my master's thesis.

* I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [YMCA University of Science and Technology](https://jcboseust.ac.in/).
* My research interests span Explainable AI, Multiagent Systems, and Robotics. I'm very open to research discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to get in touch!
