* I am currently a Research Intern at Honda Research Institute, USA, where I'm working on inferring dynamically evolving relations of multiagents in complex traffic scenes. 
* I recently completed Master of Science in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/), where I worked on Multiagent Coordination with temporal and spatial coupling requirement, using semantically meaningful skills, under supervision of [ Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/).
* I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in [YMCA University of Science and Technology](http://www.ymcaust.ac.in/), and MS in Electronics and Computer Engineering, with major in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
* My research interests span Deep Reinforcement learning, Explainable AI, Multiagent systems, and Robotics.
