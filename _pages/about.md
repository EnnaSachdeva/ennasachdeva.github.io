* I am currently a Research Intern at Honda Research Institute, USA, where I'm working on predicting and explaining relational reasoning for multiagent intelligent systems.
* I recently completed Master of Science in Robotics from [Oregon State University](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/) under supervision of [ Prof. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/). My research work included addressing structiral credit assignment problem in multiagent coordination tasks with sparse binary team rewards. 
* Prior to that, I obtained an MS in Electronics and Computer Engineering, with major in Robotics from [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), and a Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [YMCA University of Science and Technology](http://www.ymcaust.ac.in/).
* My research interests span Explainable AI, Multiagent systems, and Robotics. I'm very open to research discussion and collaboration. Please feel free to get in touch!
